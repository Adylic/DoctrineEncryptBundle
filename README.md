#DoctrineEncryptBundle

Bundle allows to create doctrine entities with fields that will be protected with 
help of some encryption algorithm in database and it will be clearly for developer, because bundle is uses doctrine life cycle events

This is an fork from the original bundle created by vmelnik-ukrain (Many thanks to him) which can be found here:
[vmelnik-ukraine/DoctrineEncryptBundle](https://github.com/vmelnik-ukraine/DoctrineEncryptBundle)

I improved several things, i make better use of the doctrine events.
and it works with lazy loading (relationships)!
